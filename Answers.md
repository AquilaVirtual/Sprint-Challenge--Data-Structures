Stack is LIFO: The last object into a stack is the first object to leave the stack.
Queeu is FIFO: The first object into a queue is the first object to leave the queue.

Retrieval Time complexity for a Linked list is O(n).
Retrieval Time complexity for Hash Table is O(1).
Retrieval Time complexity for Binary Search Tree is O(log n).

Hashes provide constant time lookups by key as opposed to constant time lookups by index.
A hash is often (but not always) faster than an array because you do not have to search through all the elements to find what you are looking for - you only have to check a few elements, and often only one if the hashing function is effective.
